      Why are we recommending not to use Essential? Here, we will list our
      reasons why you should use alternatives to it.
    </ProjectParagraph>

    <ProjectParagraph>
      Disclaimer: We are not encouraging you to hate on Essential, nor do we
      have personal beef with the Essential staff. We simply find that these
      issues are what makes Essential undesirable in most circumstances when
      playing modded Minecraft.

      <projectTitle> 1. It's closed-source. </projectTitle>
    </projectTitleBar>

    <projectParagraph>
      A piece of software being closed-source means that the source code is not
      publicly available anywhere. Usually, the software code is obfuscated as
      well, meaning that even if we have the piece of software, we still cannot
      view its code without dedicating more time to decompiling it.
    </projectParagraph>

    <projectParagraph>
      Closed-source software exists everywhere, so you might be wondering -
      "well, why is that a bad thing if there is a lot of closed-source software
      that we use?" And while that may be true, Minecraft modding is very
      different.
    </projectParagraph>

    <projectParagraph>
      Minecraft modding can be very limitless, but this is because of one thing:
      Minecraft mods have access to (almost) your entire computer. This makes it
      very risky to run mods, which means that we have to trust the code that we
      are executing.
    </projectParagraph>

    <projectParagraph>
      But, the very nature of closed-source and obfuscation hinders that in a
      very big way. If we cannot see the code that is being ran, how can we
      trust it won't be looking through our files? This is why mods being
      open-source, as well as being unobfuscated, is a big deal.
    </projectParagraph>

    <projectParagraph>
      Note: This isn't meant to imply that Essential is accessing our files. In
      fact, making it closed-source makes it less accessible for anyone (besides
      Essential devs) to verify if that statement is true or not. Also,
      Essential itself is not obfuscated, only closed-source.
    </projectParagraph>

    <ProjectParagraph>
      2nd note: Essential itself is closed-source. Its libraries that other mods
      can use (so Vigilance, Elementa, and others) are open-source and available
      on GitHub.

      <projectTitle> 2. Coin bundles </projectTitle>
    </ProjectTitleBar>

    <ProjectParagraph>
      In a game primarily played by children, Essential decides to push their
      microtransactions system, where you can buy Essential Coins and exchange
      them for cosmetics in-game.
    </ProjectParagraph>

    <ProjectParagraph>
      While this doesn't seem necessarily bad at first, and it is true that this
      is one of the more reasonable monetisation methods out there, the issue
      stems from the method to obtain coins.
    </ProjectParagraph>

    <ProjectParagraph>
      The reason why this is an issue is due to the coins only being bought in
      bundles, meaning people will most likely have to overpay to get a
      cosmetic, and then leave a bunch of coins they paid for just sitting
      around, doing nothing.
    </ProjectParagraph>

    <ProjectParagraph>
      It is understandable that Essential has a monetisation method, as it is a
      company with employees. However, coins only being obtained in bundles
      shouldn't be the case.

        3. Weird interactions with the game and (mostly) other mods
      </projectTitle>
    </projectTitleBar>

    <ProjectParagraph>
      As a mod for Minecraft, it really shouldn't be trying to break other mods,
      and as its name suggests, really shouldn't be doing much with Minecraft
      itself aside from letting your friends join your singleplayer worlds. Yet,
      this is untrue.
    </ProjectParagraph>

    <ProjectParagraph>
      For some reason, Essential's code interacts really weirdly, mostly when
      playing with other mods but also sometimes with Minecraft itself somehow.
      This has led to countless incompatibilities in one way or another, with
      many mods.
    </ProjectParagraph>

    <ProjectParagraph>
      Essential's closed-source nature means that it takes time to be able to
      troubleshoot fixes with Essential without having to brute-force a
      solution, time that is either not available or could be better spent
      improving mods.
    </ProjectParagraph>

    <ProjectParagraph>
      It is important to note that according to Essential they will make their
      mod source-available at some point, making it easier to fix
      incompatibilities. However this has been months on end now and it's
      unclear if they still plan to.

      <projectTitle> 4. Too bloated for being "essential" </projectTitle>
    </ProjectTitleBar>

    <ProjectParagraph>
      For a mod described as the "essential tools for Minecraft", it packs in a
      bunch of not very necessary things that just make the mod feel more like
      bloat and less like being a necessary toolkit to enjoy Minecraft at its
      fullest.
    </ProjectParagraph>

    <ProjectParagraph>
      Sure, it's very useful to have a world host function, a friends list
      function, a chat peek function and a zoom function. These are all well and
      good and in fact these have been so nice to have they've been recreated
      into separate mods.
    </ProjectParagraph>

    <ProjectParagraph>
      However, we can't say the same for the cosmetics, emotes, and the account
      switcher (which yes doesn't fit for most people). Mostly the cosmetics,
      since you can disable cosmetics only for yourself and players wearing
      armor (which isn't always the case).
    </ProjectParagraph>

    <ProjectParagraph>
      The cosmetics can also hamper the FPS a little bit due to the required
      animations and this would only get worse if multiple players in the same
      world/lobby are wearing cosmetics that have unique animations.

      <ProjectTitle> 5. Cluttered UI </ProjectTitle>
    </ProjectTitleBar>

    <ProjectParagraph>
      With the many features Essential has, there has to be an area to put
      buttons to these. And, if you look at the main title screen, you can see
      that Essential has... a lot of buttons there. This leads to a cluttered
      UI.
    </ProjectParagraph>

    <ProjectParagraph>
      The result is that it becomes too intrusive, almost like Essential is the
      main focus, not Minecraft. Especially on a new instance, the amount of
      screen space taken up by Essential alone makes it cumbersome to navigate
      (Not helped by Minecraft's auto-GUI scale).
    </ProjectParagraph>

    <ProjectParagraph>
      Also, some of the buttons there are not necessary. For example, the Host
      World button is a button that no one ever really clicks, so having the
      button there hurts more than it helps. Similarly, the Minecraft Folder
      button is not a button that most people will use, and having it takes up
      more of the screen which with how it looks already, is not particularly a
      good thing.
    </ProjectParagraph>

    <ProjectParagraph>
      It is important to note that the split between the necessary and
      unnecessary buttons on screen can be arguable. For example, the Hide
      Notifications button can be useful if you want to have a peaceful session
      without being hit with notifications.

    <ProjectParagraph>
      I'm sure that you may find some of Essential's features handy. We think so
      too, which is why we compiled a list of Essential alternatives so that you
      can enjoy the features you want without needing to have unnecessary
      features included.

      Feel free to explore the Alternatives page using the button below and
      check out mods we think are suitable replacements for Essential's
      features.
