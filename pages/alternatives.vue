              For multiplayer with a friends system, you can use World Host.
              It's a free and open source way to broadcast your world to those
              on your friends list, and everyone you want to share it with.
            </p>
            <p>
              It has a friends list system you can use to let your friends join
              your game right as you open it to them.
            </p>
            <p>
              You simply hit "Open to Friends" and your friends will be able to
              join. You can also share the link that appears in chat with the
              people you want to play with!
            </p>
            <p>
              This mod is recommended for mostly vanilla or lightly/client-side
              modded instances only. For better experiences with modpacks, use
              e4mc, which is featured below.

              e4mc is recommended over World Host for modpacks, as this is a
              very simple mod which means it shouldn't interfere with potential
              mods. Just make sure your modlists are identical to avoid
              de-syncing!

              Customizable Player Models is a mod that lets you deeply modify

            <p>
              It has an interface where you can add, remove, modify, model and
              texture your own player model, similar to how Blender works.
            </p>
            <p>
              The models are stored in unused space on your Minecraft Skin, or
              as a Gist on GitHub.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upload the exported image file as your skin to load the custom

              Essential's skin swapper in-game can be convenient if you want to

            </p>
            <p>
              Skin Shuffle is a mod that can change, store, and customise your
              skin, all in-game without requiring to relaunch. They are stored
              in what they call "Skin Presets" which can be created off of URLs,
              files, Usernames/UUIDs, in-game textures and even your current
              skin!
            </p>
            <p>
              If the server has Skin Shuffle installed, you can also switch your
              skin and it will be shown to everyone on the server, even those
              without the mod, all while not requiring you to disconnect from
              the server!

              If you need the other aspect of Essential's account switcher, you
              can use the aptly-named In-Game Account Switcher mod.
            </p>
            <p>
              In-Game Account Switcher has the ability to, well, switch accounts
              that are logged in, without needing to restart the game!
            </p>
            <p>
              They also have various optional security measures to increase
              security when using your accounts with IAS.

              Essential has a Discord RPC feature that displays the version and
              server you are playing on. This mod can do that AND let you
              customize it further.
            </p>
            <p>
              This popular RPC plugin allows you to broadcast your Minecraft
              gaming session to Discord and change the lines that show on your
              Discord bio when you do so.

              Essential has a zoom feature with it. This mod can replace that
              function, and it supports a LOT of Minecraft versions!
            </p>
            <p>
              Not only does it zoom in and out, it also has keybinds for
              customising the zoom level!
